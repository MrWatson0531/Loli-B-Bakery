# Loli B Bakery

This is a personal project showcasing my current skill level with React, HTML, CSS & making API calls.
This project is for a bakery website. By the end this site will be able to take customer orders, email customer receipts, store customer orders for faster check out & also send notification to the baker when an order is placed.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
